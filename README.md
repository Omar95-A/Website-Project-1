> A Website Called `Don't Give Up` Is a Online Social Counseling Platform. Provide Online Counseling Services. For Get Support and Guidance From a Licensed Therapist.

I used HTML, CSS, Icon library from Font Awesome and normalize.css v8.0.1 its A modern, HTML5-ready alternative to CSS resets. Normalize.css makes browsers render all elements more consistently and in line with modern standards.

#### To try the website: [Demo]().

It's my first template that I worked on. For work on this website i used [Leon - PSD Agency Template](https://www.graphberry.com/item/leon-psd-agency-template) which I took sketch from the [Graphberry](https://www.graphberry.com) website.

I learned how can I use the html & css professionally in design the websites with Eng. [Osama Elzero](https://elzero.org/category/courses/html-and-css-practice/)
